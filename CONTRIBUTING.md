# Contributions to Ink

We are not currently prepared to accept patches to the Ink project.

This repository is a copy of the source code maintained in a Google-internal
source repository. It does not include its tests, its third-party dependencies,
or Bazel build files. We hope, in the future, to provide everything you need to
build and use Ink in your own projects, and to accept community contributions to
Ink. For now, we hope that our publication of the source (under the Apache
license) will prove useful or interesting.

Having said that, any non-Google contributions made to this project will be
subject to the following terms and conditions.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows [Google's Open Source Community
Guidelines](https://opensource.google.com/conduct/).
