## About This Repository

This repository is a copy of the source code maintained in a Google-internal
source repository. It does not include its tests, its third-party dependencies,
or Bazel build files. We hope, in the future, to provide everything you need to
build and use Ink in your own projects, and to accept community contributions to
Ink. For now, we hope that our publication of the source (under the Apache
license) will prove useful or interesting.
